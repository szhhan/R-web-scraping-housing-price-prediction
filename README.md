## The codes for our final project are presented in two files: 

* "sta523 final project.Rmd" includes all our codes as well as writeup. To understand how our codes work, we recommend you to read this file or its corresponding html/pdf. Also note that our code involves using files from subdirectories, therefore, be sure to set knit directory as current working directory before kniting the Rmd, to avoid data importing problems. In addition, if you run the codes in Rmd chunk by chunk, then such problem won't exist. The shiny app code in Rmd is set as `eval = FALSE`. To view the shiny app, refer to "app.R".

* "app.R" includes only the shiny app code, which could run directly. The writeup for code is included in "sta523 final project.Rmd". 

* All other files in this repo are downloaded or generated datasets and auxiliary packages used throughout our codes.
